Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IS THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING,TESTING,MAINAINING ,DEPLOYING SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING HELPS IN CREATING RELIABLE, SCALABLE SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
REQUIEMENTS- gather user needs and reqirements.    
DESIGN- coming up with a layout of the code.
IMPLEMENTATION- wrting the line of code relevant to the user needs.
TESTING- examining if the written code meets the user needs and solves the user problems.
DELOYMENT- integrating the code into the user interface for use.
MAINTAINANCE- involves making changes and updates to the code in future to meet changing requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- sequantially coming up with a code coming downwards.  (WRITNG A NEW PROGRAM)
Agile - creating iterative codes relating to flexibility (WRITING  A LOOP )


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER- creates the line of code and implements it.
QUALITY ASSUARANCE MANAGER- ensures quality of code by testing and debugging it.
PROJECT MANAGER - oversees the whole process of planning and delivering software product.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
*IDEs - they provide the right platform and tools to write,test and develop code. (VISUAL STUDIO, ECLIPSE)
*VCS - they track changes in code and help with working with team members. (GIT)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a)TIGHT DEADLINES- delivering software products under strict deadlines can compromise the quality.
b)COST- maintenance costs of software products can be very high.
c)CHANGING NEEDS- project requirements change with time leading to delays and numerous changes. 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a)UNIT TESTING- THIS REFERS TO TESTING INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF THE SYSTEM
b)INTEGRATION TESTING- AIMS TO CHECK THE INTERRELATION OF DIFFERENT SUBSYSTEMS. 
c)SYSTEM TESTING - CHECKS THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
d)ACCEPTANCE TESTING- AIMS AT CONFIRMING IF THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE MEETS THE END USER REQUIREMENTS.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-PROMPT ENGINEERING INVOLVES USE OF AI TO GENERATE ACCURATE RESPONSES BASED ON GIVEN OUTPUT.
-PROMPT ENGINEERING HELPS COME UP WITH ACCURATE RESPONSES.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
